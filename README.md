# demand-prediction

Machine learning and data exploration project using scikit-learn, Keras and seaborn libraries

## About this project

This project was undertaken as a long-term group assignment as part of my econometrics major.

The details of the task are kept under wraps to prevent plagiarism. At a high level, the task involved training a series of candidate models for predicting a continuous variable ('demand') based on provided variables. A champion model was then chosen through cross-validation and marked according to its performance on unseen data versus other groups.

## Repository structure

`data` contains the two .csv files provided to all groups. This data should not be changed. `training.csv` contains the dataset used to train and validate candidate models. `test.csv` is a dummy dataset used to ensure the submitted notebook can be marked using the unseen data.

`models` contains the python code submitted for marking. Exploratory data analysis and all candidate models are stored in separate notebooks, and then combined in `demand-prediction.ipynb`

The final report written to accompany the code submission is omitted from this repo. Email me to request a copy.
